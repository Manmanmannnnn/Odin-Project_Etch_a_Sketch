# Odin-Project_Etch_a_Sketch

This webpage creates a 16x16 grid of squares using JavaScript and Flexbox, allowing users to interact with the grid by changing the color of squares when hovered over while click. Users can also resize the grid by entering a new number of squares per side, while the total pixel space remains constant. The grid also features a progressive darkening effect(pencil option) and random color ink, enhancing the interactivity and user experience.
